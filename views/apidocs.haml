      %h2 Overview      
      %p 
        There are 2 types of requests to the Zelus APIs:
        %ul
          %li HTTP GET - not authenticated, used to retrieve data only
          %li HTTP POST - authenticated by an API key, used to create or update records in Zelus
      
        Generally to get data from Zelus, you will do something like the following:
        
        %p
          %pre
            GET /person/&lt;uuid&gt;
      %br

      %h3 UUID
      %p 
        A UUID is a unique identifier, which is compatible with 
        %a{href:"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt"} RFC4122.
        All entities in Zelus are uniquely identified by their UUID. To reference an entity within
        Zelus, you need to know its UUID.
      %br
    .row        
      %h2 API key
      %p
        Every POST request must be made with an API key. You can also attach a GET request with an API 
        key although it is not necessary. Each request (GET or POST) is logged and you will be able to 
        keep track on your own API calls (future feature).
      
      %p
        %pre
          POST /person?api_key=&lt;api-key&gt;

      %p
        If you want to create records, please submit a request to create a user account in Zelus.
